# Wi-Fi Tool privacy policy

Welcome to the Wi-Fi Tool app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Devendra Tewari. The source code is available at GitHub under the [MIT license](../License.md).

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the [AndroidManifest.xml](./app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) file.
